### Reflection 1
Adding the new edit and delete product feature is quite interesting. I have never worked with using Java to do MVC work. Nonetheless, there were quite a few errors originally, such as forgetting to include ProductId to edit a product. Everything else went fine, I copy-pasted the original CreateProduct.html and slightly edited it for EditProduct.html.
